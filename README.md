# HiberniaVPN
Hibernia offers a premium VPN service with a low, commitment free monthly price. The service is anonymous and does not collect or require any personal data: subscribe with one tap in the app and connect to a range of global servers.
# Hibernia's iOS Client
We believe in transparency and have therefore made the decision to open source our iOS client app. While subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store (meaning that only the published version can access the VPN), the source repository is public here so you can see for yourself our commitment to a no-log and anonymous service.
